# CTRL + F

This project contains a _script_ that was developed to search for pre-defined words in all columns of a spreadsheet's text type.

At the end, a copy of the base file is generated with an additional column that informs which word was found and in which column.


## Usage example

1. Create a spreadsheet based on the words to be searched for:

2. Select the Word file and the base file that will be consulted.
3. Indicate if there is any line in the base file that should be ignored
4. Indicate the tab name to be processed in the base file
5. Click on Process File and wait for it to finish
